Life-Steal Fork:
----------------

* New game fee of 20 HUC for destruct and 5 HUC (in addition
  to the 200 HUC locked in the hunter) for spawning hunters.

* Carrying capacity lowered to 100 HUC (crown holder is still exempt).

* Death on a bank happens now after 2 blocks, not 30 as before.

* Hearts never spawn.

* At the fork, all hearts are removed and all hearted characters
  killed immediately.  Coins are handled as per disaster death.

* Death by disaster now refunds the general cost.  The collected coins
  are added to the game fund (minus miner tax).

* Destructing is not lethal for the hunter itself.

* Waypoints and destruct can be set at once in a valid move.

* Use life-steal to handle destructs.  In particular:
  1) Mutual attacks of a pair of hunters are considered "void" and not
     processed at all.  Kind of like a "defense".
  2) Hunters with at least as many attackers as their current value
     die.  Their coins are dropped on the floor as before (including miner
     tax).  Their value is not part of that.
  3) Each attacker that is still alive gets life from each victim.  If the
     victim has not enough for all alive attackers, this is done randomly.
     If the victim has less than 200 HUC value, this is added to the game fund
     instead.  The same is true if the "rightful owner" (attacker) has died
     itself.

* Spawning of characters (and their initial direction) is now random
  among all walkable tiles.

* Banks are no longer at the corners, but instead randomly placed.
  At the fork height, 75 banks are placed with a random life time
  between 25 and 100 blocks.  Whenever the life time of a bank
  runs out, it is randomly re-created on a fresh walkable tile
  and with a fresh life time.
